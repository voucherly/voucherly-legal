# Terms of Service

Versione 1.0 del 24/11/2023

Terms of Service
================================================================================================

If you signed a separate Cover Page to access the Voucherly Cloud Service with the same account, and that agreement has not ended, the terms below do not apply to you. 
Instead, your separate Cover Page applies to your use of the Product.

This Agreement is between Bognini Francesco (“Voucherly”) and the company or person accessing or using the Cloud Service. 
This Agreement consists of: (1) the Order Form and (2) the Key Terms, both of which are on the Cover Page below, and (3) the <a href="https://commonpaper.com/standards/cloud-service-agreement/1.0">Common Paper Cloud Service Standard Terms Version 1.0</a> (“Standard Terms"). 
Any modifications to the Standard Terms made in the Cover Page will control over conflicts with the Standard Terms. Capitalized words have the meanings given in the Cover Page or the Standard Terms. 

If you are accessing or using the Cloud Service on behalf of your company, you represent that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on behalf of your company. 
By signing up, accessing, or using the Product, Customer indicates its acceptance of this Agreement and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.


## Cover Page

    ### Order Form
        **Cloud Service:** The Cloud Service is a payment platform comprised of three primary components: 
        (i) a checkout page that allow users to pay using their favourite payment method, particularly meal vouchers, and 
        (ii) an interactive user interface and 
        (iii) a set of APIs through which a Voucherly user may view information about and manage a Merchant.
        
        **Subscription Start Date:** The Effective Date

        **Subscription Period:** One month

        **Non-Renewal Notice Period:** At least 7 days before the end of the current Subscription Period.

        **Currency:** In section 5.1 of the Standard Terms, “U.S. Dollars” is replaced with “Euros”.

        **Fees:** Section 5.2 of the Standard Terms is replaced with: Certain parts of the Product have different pricing plans, which are available at Provider’s <a href="https://voucherly.it/#plans">pricing page</a>, unless you and Voucherly otherwise agree in writing. Within the Payment Period, Customer will pay Provider fees based on the Product tier selected at the time of account creation and Customer’s usage per Subscription Period. Provider may update Product pricing by giving at least 30 days notice to Customer (including by email or notification within the Product), and the change will apply in the next Subscription Period.

## Key Terms

    *   <em>Eligibility</em>. Only businesses (including sole proprietors) and non-profit organisations located in Italy are eligible to apply for a Voucherly Account and use the Services. 
            Voucherly and its Affiliates may provide Services to you or your Affiliates in other countries or regions under separate agreements. 
            You and your Representative must not attempt to create a Voucherly Account on behalf of or for the benefit of a user whose use of the Voucherly services was suspended or terminated by Voucherly, unless Voucherly approves otherwise.
    *   <em>Business Representative</em>. You and your Representative individually affirm to Voucherly that (1) your Representative is authorised to provide User Information on your behalf and to bind you to this Agreement; and (2) your Representative is an executive officer, director, senior manager or otherwise has significant responsibility for the control, management or direction of your business.
            Voucherly may require you or your Representative to provide additional information or documentation demonstrating your Representative’s authority.
    *   <em>Sole Proprietors</em>. If you are a sole proprietor, you and your Representative also affirm that your Representative is personally responsible and liable for your use of the Services and your obligations to Customers, including payment of amounts you owe under this Agreement.

If you are a sole proprietor, and you are not old enough to enter into a contract on your own behalf (which is commonly but not always 18 years old), but you are 13 years old or older, your Representative must be your parent or legal guardian. If you are a legal entity that is owned, directly or indirectly, by an individual who is not old enough to enter into a contract on their own behalf, but the individual is 13 years old or older, your Representative must obtain the consent of either your board or an authorised officer.
